### Cyber Risk Intelligence System for Prioritized Remediation

**Not another risk score - a ₹-quantified, source-verified investment decision.**

CRISPR turns tens of thousands of raw security findings into **financial risk a board can act on** - Expected Annual Loss (EAL) and Value at Risk (VaR) in rupees - then recommends the exact set of controls that cuts the most risk under a fixed budget.

## 📌 TL;DR

Enterprises spend heavily on cybersecurity, yet risk is still reported as vague **"Low / Medium / High"** ratings that never answer the only question leadership asks: *how much money are we exposed to, and where should the next rupee go?*

CRISPR fuses security telemetry with **asset criticality** and **control effectiveness** into a single FAIR-based engine, uses a **calibrated XGBoost model** (trained on **~320,000 CVE records**) to score exploitation likelihood, and a **budget-constrained optimizer** to recommend the highest-impact controls. A **deterministic, evidence-gated financial engine** guarantees that every ₹ figure is traceable to source — the AI narrates numbers, it never invents them.

## 🎯 The Problem

Security findings arrive by the tens of thousands - from scanners, SIEM, EDR, CSPM and threat intel - but they are ranked by **technical severity (CVSS)**, not **business impact**.

> **CVSS ≠ business risk.** A "critical" CVE on an isolated test box matters less than a "medium" on a payment database.

Boards are handed heatmaps that cannot tell them:

- 💰 **How much money** are we exposed to, in rupees?
- 🎯 **Which fixes first** reduce that exposure the most?
- 📊 Is our security spend going to **real business risk** or to noise?
- 📝 Can we **prove to an auditor** why each risk was prioritized?

Manual, periodic assessments go stale - by the time a report is written, assets and threats have changed. The result is alert fatigue, mis-allocated spend, SLA breaches, and cyber risk that never enters board-level financial decisions.

**Why it matters in India (2026):** average data-breach cost hit a record **₹25.5 Cr** (IBM, +15.9% YoY; BFSI highest at ₹40.9 Cr) · Indian BFSI faces attacks at **1.6× the global average** · mean time to contain a breach is **263 days and rising** (DSCI–BCG).

## 🔄 How It Works

CRISPR runs a four-stage pipeline: **Collect → Quantify → Optimize → Decide** - with AI supporting every stage.

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    C["1️⃣ COLLECT<br/>Continuously integrate<br/>enterprise security data"]
    Q["2️⃣ QUANTIFY<br/>Model exploitation +<br/>compute ₹ EAL / VaR"]
    O["3️⃣ OPTIMIZE<br/>Maximize risk reduction<br/>under ₹ budget"]
    D["4️⃣ DECIDE<br/>Board-ready dashboards<br/>+ framework evidence"]

    C --> Q --> O --> D
    D -.feedback / re-scan.-> C

    style C fill:#e3f2fd,stroke:#1565c0,stroke-width:2px
    style Q fill:#e8f5e9,stroke:#2e7d32,stroke-width:2px
    style O fill:#fff3e0,stroke:#e65100,stroke-width:2px
    style D fill:#e0f7fa,stroke:#00838f,stroke-width:2px
```

**1 · Collect** - Live connectors (NVD, CISA KEV, GitHub, generic HTTP) plus a normalization layer ingest, cleanse, deduplicate and correlate findings; an asset-criticality engine performs threat-likelihood weighting and entity resolution across sources.

**2 · Quantify** - The XGBoost model scores exploitation likelihood per CVE. The FAIR engine combines Asset Criticality, Control Effectiveness and evidence-backed Loss Magnitude to produce `EAL = Σ (Pᵢ × Lᵢ)` and `VaR = VaRα(L)`.

**3 · Optimize** - A greedy marginal-ROSI optimizer selects the control portfolio maximizing risk reduction under budget; 10,000 seeded Monte Carlo runs produce reproducible 95% / 99% VaR.

**4 · Decide** - Executive and technical dashboards, compliance mapping, and a natural-language advisor turn technical findings into defensible financial decisions.

### Model at a glance

| Property | Value |
|---|---|
| **Algorithm** | XGBoost 3.4 · 235 estimators · max depth 8 |
| **Dataset** | ~320,000 CVE records (256K train / 64K test) |
| **Label** | `exploited = is_kev` - CISA KEV catalog only (no synthetic labels, no EPSS in the label) |
| **Positives** | 1,592 KEV CVEs · **imbalance ≈ 200:1 (~0.5% base rate)** |
| **Features** | 20 real features - EPSS score/percentile, CVSS, exploitability & impact sub-scores, attack vector, and CWE-type flags (RCE, SQLi, XSS, buffer overflow, priv-esc, DoS, dir-traversal) |
| **Calibration** | Platt scaling |
| **Explainability** | SHAP (top drivers: EPSS percentile, EPSS score, exploitability score) |

### Evaluation

| Split | ROC-AUC | PR-AUC | Notes |
|---|:---:|:---:|---|
| **Stratified random** | **0.982** | **0.479** | F1 0.524 · Precision 0.575 · Recall 0.481 |
| **5-fold stratified CV** | 0.985 | 0.503 | ±0.002 / ±0.037 |
| **Temporal (forward)** | 0.981 | 0.491 | trains on past, tests on future |
| **Ablation — no EPSS** | 0.853 | 0.124 | isolates EPSS contribution |
| **Calibrated (production)** | 0.982 | 0.481 | deployed model |

> On a **~0.5% base-rate** problem, a random classifier scores PR-AUC ≈ 0.005 - so **PR-AUC 0.479 is ~96× over random**. The ablation shows the full model (0.479) meaningfully outperforms EPSS-derived signal alone: EPSS is our strongest input, not our whole model.

## 🛡️ The Evidence-Gated Financial Engine

This is the heart of CRISPR's trust story. The financial engine is **deterministic and evidence-gated**: a loss event **cannot be created** without citing frequency and loss evidence. The AI never derives ₹ figures from a classifier - it narrates numbers the engine computed and traces every one to source.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant U as Analyst / API
    participant E as Financial Engine
    participant V as Evidence Validator
    participant M as Monte Carlo (10K seeded)

    U->>E: Submit RiskEvent(s)<br/>(probability, loss, evidence)
    E->>V: Validate frequency_evidence<br/>+ loss_evidence present?
    alt ❌ Evidence missing / untraceable
        V-->>U: Reject (redacted — cannot verify)
    else ✅ Evidence present
        V->>M: Run 10,000 seeded iterations<br/>(+ correlated shock groups)
        M-->>E: Loss distribution
        E-->>U: EAL (mean) · VaR (P95/P99)<br/>every figure traceable to evidence
    end
```

**How the guardrail is enforced:** each `RiskEvent` requires non-empty `frequency_evidence` and `loss_evidence`; any non-zero control effect requires `control_evidence`; duplicate events are rejected to prevent double-counting; and correlated incidents are modelled explicitly via **shock groups**. Reproducibility is guaranteed by a fixed seed - the same inputs always produce the same VaR.

> **Demo vs Live modes** (`CRISPR_DATA_MODE`): *demo* runs on a seeded reference environment for reproducibility; *live* mode requires organization-approved, persisted, evidence-backed values before any figure is shown.

---

## 🎛️ Investment Optimizer

CRISPR selects the control portfolio that maximizes risk reduction under a fixed budget using a **greedy marginal-ROSI** strategy. Greedy selection is deliberate: it correctly handles **overlapping control benefits** (where two controls reduce the same risk), which a naïve 0/1 knapsack over-counts.

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    B["💰 Budget (₹)"] --> L{"Marginal ROSI<br/>of each remaining control?"}
    L -->|"pick highest ROSI<br/>≥ threshold"| SEL["Add control<br/>recompute EAL"]
    SEL --> L
    L -->|"budget exhausted<br/>or ROSI below threshold"| OUT["✅ Optimal control set<br/>+ ROSI + residual risk"]

    style B fill:#fff3e0,stroke:#e65100
    style OUT fill:#e8f5e9,stroke:#2e7d32
```

Each candidate control carries a cost, complexity, implementation time, and its effect on the simulated enterprise EAL - so the recommendation is always an **investment decision with a return**, not a checklist.

---

## 📋 Compliance Mapping

Controls are mapped to five frameworks, giving auditors a traceable line from a fix to a control reference.

| Control | ISO/IEC 27001 | NIST CSF 2.0 | CIS v8.1 | RBI CSF | SEBI CSCRF |
|---|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| MFA | A.9.4 | PR.AC-7 | CIS-6 | IAM-3 | AC-2 |
| Patching | A.12.6 | PR.IP-12 | CIS-7 | VM-2 | CM-3 |
| Segmentation | A.13.1 | PR.AC-5 | CIS-12 | NS-4 | SC-7 |
| EDR | A.12.2 | DE.CM-4 | CIS-10 | EP-1 | SI-3 |
| Backup | A.12.3 | PR.IP-4 | CIS-11 | BC-2 | CP-9 |

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Docker** & **Docker Compose v2**
- `curl` and `python3` (used for secure key generation)

### Option A — One-command setup (recommended)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/JashwanthMU/CRISPR.git
cd CRISPR
./install.sh
```

`install.sh` verifies your Docker environment, generates a `.env` with secure secrets, builds the images, and starts the full stack.

### Option B — Manual (Make)

```bash
cp .env.example .env          # then fill in the values (see below)
make up                       # build & start all services
make migrate                  # apply database migrations
make logs                     # tail logs
make down                     # stop everything
```

**Handy Make targets:** `dev` · `up` · `down` · `logs` · `migrate` · `test` · `test-backend` · `test-frontend` · `audit`

### Services

| Service | Description |
|---|---|
| `backend` | FastAPI API (Swagger at `/docs` when `API_DOCS_ENABLED=true`) |
| `sih-frontend` | React + Vite dashboard |
| `worker` | Background ingestion / jobs |
| `db` | PostgreSQL |

> Once running, open the frontend (default **http://localhost:5173**) and the API (default **http://localhost:8000**). Confirm exact ports in `docker-compose.yml`.

### Key environment variables (`.env`)

```ini

## 🖱️ Usage

CRISPR ships with two role-based workspaces, reachable from the login screen:

- **👔 Executive** — enterprise risk score, ₹ financial exposure, what-if scenarios, board briefing.
- **🔧 Technical** — control-level drill-down, per-finding SHAP drivers, framework mapping.

Ask the built-in advisor questions like *"What is our highest financial cyber risk today?"* and CRISPR answers in plain English — with every ₹ figure traceable to its evidence.

---

## 🧪 Testing

```bash
make test            # full suite
make test-backend    # backend only
make test-frontend   # frontend only
```

The backend ships **119 test functions across 24 files**, including determinism/reproducibility tests for the financial engine and Monte Carlo, connector tests (CISA KEV, NVD), and AI-assistant fallback tests. CI runs on GitHub Actions (Python 3.12).

---

## 🔐 Security

- **Role-based access control** — executive / technical / reporter roles.
- **JWT authentication** with configurable token lifetime.
- **Encrypted connector credentials** (`INTEGRATION_ENCRYPTION_KEY`); HTTPS-only connectors by default.
- **Evidence-gated financial engine** — untraceable figures are rejected, not displayed.
- **Deterministic, reproducible outputs** — fixed seeds for auditability.
